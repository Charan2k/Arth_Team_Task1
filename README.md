# Arth_Team_Task1
Here in this project, we tried to include all the concepts that we had learned and we know until this time.
We tried to integrate all those concepts/technologies with the help of Python.
In this ultimate project we try to automate some of the things with the help of Python Programming using a simple menu.
We included hadoop, docker, web server, partitions and AWS menu's in this simple yet powerful project.
This project will be a menu driven python program which will ease the user in easily working in the above mentioned technologies.
Right now, it is still in developing mode, so we might add some more options in the future.
